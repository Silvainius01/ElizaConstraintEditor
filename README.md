# Eliza Constraint Editor

Made for Eliza (and whomever she shares this with) by Silvainius

I heavily referenced code and design from Dreadrith's fork of s-m-k's Animation Heirarchy:
https://github.com/Dreadrith/Unity-Animation-Hierarchy-Editor

Sure, my stuff is completely different now, but I copied how they did some stuff so its mentioned.
